# youtube-subscriptions-filtering
Additional filtering options of videos on your personal Subscriptions page

- Hide videos that have already been viewed
- Hide videos based on title, either for All channel or on a per-channel basis (using regular expressions)

Currently works with the Grid-view of the Subscriptions page.

Settings are stored within the internal Tamper/GreaseMonkey storage. Exporting the script "including script storage" and importing into another instance of Tamper/GreaseMonkey should keep your settings.
