# Ad-muter
Automatically mutes the player during video ads. Pauses after the video ad is done, so you can leave without missing main video.

Note: Uncertain about how the script works with long videos that have multiple video ads in them.


# Custom player size
Set the exact width and height of the video player in pixels.

WARNING: Currently breaks fullscreen view.


# Playlist total time
Counts and displays the total time of a playlist on the playlist page.


# Subscriptions filtering
Additional filtering options of videos on your personal Subscriptions page

- Hide videos that have already been viewed
- Hide videos based on title, either for All channel or on a per-channel basis (using regular expressions)

Settings are stored within the internal Tamper/GreaseMonkey storage. Exporting the script "including script storage" and importing into another instance of Tamper/GreaseMonkey should keep your settings.
